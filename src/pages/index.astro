	quoteText="Anna was an incredible host and made our trip to Tanzania so special. We first arrived on Valentines day and our room was beautifully decorated with rose petals. We took an incredible safari to both the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater, sang songs making coffee in a trail near Moshi and found a handbag at a small shop in Arusha. Our trip was unforgettable thanks to Anna and we hope to visit again!"
